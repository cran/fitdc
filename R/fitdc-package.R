#' fitdc: R package for decoding FIT files.
#'
#' A pure R FIT file decoder. After having a package pulled from CRAN due to
#' licensing issues with the FIT SDK, the only way to bring that package back
#' from the dead was to put this together. As far as I'm concerned, it is fit
#' for purpose, but I am aware it is not a \emph{complete} implementation. If
#' this does not meet your needs in its current state, feel free to submit a
#' patch.
#'
#' Anyhow, performance is suprisingly good, and the package is written to have
#' no external dependencies. I hope you find it useful!
